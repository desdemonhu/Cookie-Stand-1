  <h4><em>is there really fish in those delicious cookies?..</em></h4>
    <p> Yes! there is loads of fish, local, wild and delicious salmon!
      it is actually what contributes to the flaky texture! we combine ground salmon with four, coconut oilr
      barley syrup and nepalese pink salt to make them. These are the healthiest cookies you will ever eat!

      Salmon treats are not new in this area, first nations have been smoking salmon with maple syrup
      for as long as Sassquatch has been throwing rocks at tourists and eating lone hikers. In fact
      the locals here call it "Salmon Candy"

    We decided to push it one step further and make cookies! they make a great compliment to local hoppy ales and coffee
  the hipsters love them!
